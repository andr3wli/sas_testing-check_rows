## Acknowledgements

SAS syntax highlighting was made possible by
[https://highlightjs.org/](highlight.js) although I contributed to the
code by adding coverage for SAS log messages (errors, warnings, and
notes). The use of icons were made possible by the
[fontawesome](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome) quartro
extension. Lastly, the slide deck was inspired by [Indrajeet
Patil](https://sites.google.com/site/indrajeetspatilmorality/home).
