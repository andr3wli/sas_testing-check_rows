## Acknowledgements

SAS syntax highlighting was made possible by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) although I contributed to the code by adding coverage for SAS log messages (errors, warnings, and notes). The use of icons were made possible by the [fontawesome](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome) quartro extension. Lastly, the slide deck was inspired by [Indrajeet Patil](https://sites.google.com/site/indrajeetspatilmorality/home).
